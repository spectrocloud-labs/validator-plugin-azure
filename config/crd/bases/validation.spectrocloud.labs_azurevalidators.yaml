                  description: RoleAssignmentRule is a rule that validates that a
                    desired role assignment exists within a subscription. The role
                    is specified as its role name (e.g. "Contributor"). The validator
                    takes care of looking up the details of the role definition associated
                    with the role name automatically.

                        which is the name of the role with the role name \"Contributor\".
                        This allows role assignments with custom roles to be validated
                        too, not just built-in roles. \n If role is specified, it
                        is used. If role is not specified but role name is specified,
                        role name is used. If neither are specified, it is a misconfiguration
                        and validation will fail. \n TODO: Look into if we can use
                        a webhook to validate this at apply time instead of allowing
                        it to cause validation to fail at runtime."
